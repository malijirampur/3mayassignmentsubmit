    <h1>Nesting operator</h1>
    <p>Nesting operators are used to position abbreviation elements inside generated tree: whether it should be placed inside or near the context element.</p>
    <h2>Self closing tags</h2>
    <p>A traditional HTML tag such as p, div, section, etc., had an opening tag and a closing tag. However, due to their fundamental structure, void components in HTML, such as images and links, do not technically require closing tags. Images and links cannot have content - they are pointers to an element installed on the website.
        Instead of including independent opening and closing tags in more modern HTML variants such as XHTML, developers employ a self-closing tag that includes a "/" within the carets (\<>). For example â€“ <img src="image/circle" alt="example" /></p>
        <h3>Meta tags</h3>
        <p>The <meta> tag defines metadata about an HTML document. Metadata is data (information) about data.

            <meta> tags always go inside the <head> element, and are typically used to specify character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings.
            
            Metadata will not be displayed on the page, but is machine parsable.
            
            Metadata is used by browsers (how to display content or reload page), search engines (keywords), and other web services.
            
            There is a method to let web designers take control over the viewport (the user's visible area of a web page), through the <meta> tag </p>
            <h4>Global attributes</h4>
            <p>HTML global attributes refer to the attribute common to all HTML elements although they may have no effect on some elements. Global attributes specified on both standard and non-standard elements.</p>
            <h5>5 global attributes</h5>
            <ul>accesskey: It is the keyboard shortcuts to activate/focus specific elements</ul>
            <ul>autocapitalize: It is used to capitalize the text entered/edited by the user automatically.</ul>
            <ul>autofocus: The autofocus attribute in HTML is used to specify that the element should get focus when the page loads. It is a boolean attribute.</ul>
            <ul>class: It specifies one or more class names for an HTML element.</ul>
            <ul>contenteditable: It is used to specify whether the content present in the element is editable or not. When this attribute is not set in an element, this element will inherit from its parent element.</ul>
