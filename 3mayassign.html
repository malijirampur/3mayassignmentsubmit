   <h1><b>I am happy to Learn Web Development</b></h1>
   <p>Web development is a fast growing form of artistic expression that uses computer programming and technical writing skills to create Web sites. Web developers earn an appealing salary that increases as specialized skills are introduced. Formal education and training play a vital role in the preparation and experience of a developer. A survey indicates that most companies today have a Web site and need the skills of developers. Legal issues for developers and employers are introduced. The steps needed to follow a career choice in Web development are outlined. Recommendations and educational needs are discussed. For high school students, this career focuses on aspects of the Web development industry from programming to graphics.</p>
   <p>I propose to reflect how the fast growing industry of Web development offers a creative and diverse opportunity to work in a field that fulfills the needs of the employers of today. I will address why Web development is a dynamic career choice for high school students, and how to get started in this career.

Almost all successful companies have a working Web site and depend on it for supplying everything from information to the actual purchase of products and services. The needs of these employers are fulfilled by Web developers who are trained to not only publish Web sites, but to create a vibrant presentation that supplies information and services to their clients. The Web site we need did not magically appear; it was the detailed work of a skilled Web developer.

<h2>Tags</h2>
<p>HTML tags are like keywords which defines that how web browser will format and display the content. With the help of tags, a web browser can distinguish between an HTML content and a simple content. HTML tags contain three main parts: opening tag, content and closing tag. But some HTML tags are unclosed tags.

    When a web browser reads an HTML document, browser reads it from top to bottom and left to right. HTML tags are used to create HTML documents and render their properties. Each HTML tags have different properties.
    
    An HTML file must have some essential tags so that web browser can differentiate between a simple text and HTML text. You can use as many tags you want as per your code requirement.
    </p>
    <p><b>Examples</b></p>
        <ol> All HTML tags must enclosed within < > these brackets.</ol>
        <ol>Every tag in HTML perform different tasks.</ol>
        <ol> If you have used an open tag <tag>, then you must use a close tag </tag> (except some tags)</ol>
        <h3>Elements</h3>
        <p>An HTML file is made of elements. These elements are responsible for creating web pages and define content in that webpage. An element in HTML usually consist of a start tag <tag name>, close tag </tag name> and content inserted between them. Technically, an element is a collection of start tag, attributes, end tag, content between them.</p>
            <P><B>Examples</B></P>
            <p><p> Hello world!!! </p> </p>
            <h3>Attributes</h3>
            <p>HTML attributes are special words which provide additional information about the elements or attributes are the modifier of the HTML element.
                Each element or tag can have attributes, which defines the behaviour of that element.
                Attributes should always be applied with start tag.
                The Attribute should always be applied with its name and value pair.
                The Attributes name and values are case sensitive, and it is recommended by W3C that it should be written in Lowercase only.
                You can add multiple attributes in one HTML element, but need to give space between two attributes.</p>
                <h4>Emmets</h4>
                <p>Emmet is a free add-on for your text editor that allows you to type shortcuts that are then expanded into full pieces of code. By using Emmet, email designers type less, saving both keystrokes and time when building a campaign. Also, relying on Emmetâ€™s autocompletion means fewer typos and missing tags, leading to more robust emails.</p>
